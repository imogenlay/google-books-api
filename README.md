# Google Books API Search Engine

This project allows for very simple interaction with the Google Books API.
Uses:

- React
- JS
- SASS
- Asynchronous programming
- Array iterators
- Testable scripts

## Usage

The page contains a few elements:

- Header section introducing the page
- Form containing a text input and a search button
- When the search button is clicked, the value from the input is used to search the Google Books API with the user's query string
- A grid of books displays what is received from the API
- Each book has an image, title, author and description
- The grid is responsive on different screen sizes
- When no book results can be found for the query, feedback to the user is provided
- Modules for styling with SCSS features
- Clicking on one of the books in the grid will display a modal.

## To Do

- When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
- Pagination
