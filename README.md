# Google Books API Search Engine

This project allows for very simple interaction with the Google Books API.
Uses:

- React
- JS

## Usage

The page contains a few elements:

- When the search button is clicked, the value from the input is used to search the Google Books API with the user's query string
- A grid of books displays what is received from the API
- Each book has an image, title, author and description
- The grid is responsive on different screen sizes
