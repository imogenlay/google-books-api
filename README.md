# Google Books API Search Engine

This project allows for very simple interaction with the Google Books API.
Uses:

- React
- JS
- SASS
- Asynchronous programming

## Usage

The page contains a few elements.

- Header section introducing the page
- Form containing a text input and a search button
- When the search button is clicked, the value from the input is used to search the Google Books API with the user's query string
- A grid of books displays what is received from the API
- Each book has an image, title, author and description
- The grid is responsive on different screen sizes

Styling (required):

This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design - this will also help with splitting the app into React components. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.

Use modules for styling, don't forget about other SCSS features, like a separate file for palette or variables.

Application Design (required):

- Remember that some JavaScript logic, like functions that fetch data, can be moved to their own .js files
- Always use iterators over loops
- Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.
- Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.

## Bonus (optional, but highly recommended):

- When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
- Include pagination

## Extension features

- Discuss with a coach
